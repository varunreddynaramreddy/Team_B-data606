## Advanced Data Driven Marketing for Optimizing Business's Marketing ROIs
Marketing is a great tool for most of the businesses for boosting sales. It is an important function in any business as production and distribution largely depend on marketing success. With the growth of technology and digital marketing, traditional marketing channels like direct telemarketing etc., are failing to capture business attention. One the major reason for this is the swift change in business operations as well as customer needs. Data driven campaign management in direct telemarketing can improve the performance. Advent of **Covid in 2020** is demanding more returns from marketing activities with limited or reduced budget across businesses. Data driven campaign management is the only option for business under these circumstances for Optimizing revenue generated from marketing campaigns.

### Project Scope
Current project scope will be limited to Telemarketing. one of the traditional direct marketing strategies. Direct telemarketing enjoys certain major advantages over other marketing channels in terms of Ease of Targeting, Personalization and Measurability (which digital channels lack majorly). The act of telemarketing has four major categories Outbound Calls, Inbound Calls, Lead Generation and Sales. Current solution doesnt differentitate between these categories due to data limitations. 
**Direct marketing campaign data** of a **Portuguese banking institution** will be used for this project. Dataset captures the marketing campaigns which are run on phone where more than one contact to the same client is required  in order to access if back term deposit would be subscribed by the customer or not.
